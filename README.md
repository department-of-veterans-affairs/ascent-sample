# README #

You are in the "master" branch of Ascent Sample Repository. This space documents all the steps that are necessary to get the *ASCENT SAMPLE DEMO SERVICE* up and running locally and other environments.

As we haven't promoted the code yet to any cloud environments, the most current branch is "development". So for developers who are looking to install the demo sample service or browse the codebase, switch to development branch. 

There are multiple documentation pages created in Wiki section of this repository. Find some time to read those pages and provide any constructive feedback to the platform team.
